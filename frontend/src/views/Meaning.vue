          <ul>
            <li><strong>YCHJCYADFTCSO:</strong> Your curiosity has just cost you a donation for the 
              Colorado <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://specialolympicsco.org">Special Olympics.</a></li>
            <li><strong>YCHJCYAQFTLHPB:</strong> Your curiosity has just cost you a quarter for the

            <li><strong>IITYWYBMAD:</strong> If I tell you will you buy me a drink?</li>

          <p>Now all of this can seem kinda silly but the Elk's organization 
            is a charitable one and the Colorado Special Olympics and Laradon 
            are both organizations that this Denver #17 lodge actively support.
          </br> There are many other things that go on here and charities that we
          support.  If your interested in knowing more go to 
          <strong><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://denverelks.org">Denver Elks #17</a></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you like please make a donation here at the lodge or online, as they
            are both worthwhile charities.  Otherwise, enjoy and vote on 
            (when available) other people's guesses.
